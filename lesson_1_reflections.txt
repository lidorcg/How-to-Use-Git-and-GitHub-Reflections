How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  If one version works in the other doesn't then it can only because of the
  differences between the two so seeing only the differences really cleans up
  all the useless noise around and let's you focus only on what night be the
  source of the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  You often do amount of work before testing your program, when you find out you
  broke something you want to be able to get back to the last point when it
  worked and try to figure out what happen the next step.
  access to the history of the file can let you find this point quickly and
  effortlessly.

  As a person who learns over time you always make mistakes, you try one way and
  then change your mind and change it again and sometimes you even return to
  your previous ideas, when that happens you want a fast way to checkout your
  previous work and continue from where you've left off.
